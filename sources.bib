abstract = {Potassium ion current in nerve membrane, I(K), has traditionally been described by I(K) = g(K)(V - E(K)), where g(K) is the K ion conductance, V is membrane potential and E(K) is the K(+) Nernst potential. This description has been unchallenged by most investigators in neuroscience since its introduction almost 60 years ago. The problem with the I(K) approximately (V - E(K)) proportionality is that it is inconsistent with the unequal distribution of K ions in the intra- and extracellular bathing media. Under physiological conditions the intracellular K(+) concentration is significantly higher than the extracellular concentration. Consequently, the slope conductance at potentials positive to E(K) cannot be the same as that for potentials negative to E(K), as the linear proportionality between I(K) and (V - E(K)) requires. Instead I(K) has a non-linear dependence on (V - E(K)) which is well described by the Goldman-Hodgkin-Katz equation. The implications of this result for K(+) channel gating and membrane excitability are reviewed in this report.},

abstract = {Recent research on structure-function relationships aspects of voltage-gated sodium channels (VGSCs) are reviewed. Data issued from the literature are summarized and compared, including results from our own studies. The latter deal with the effects of drug binding, deglycosylation and the role of hydrophobic residues in the voltage sensors. Methods mainly consist of circular dichroism (CD) to asses the channel's secondary structure and conductance measurements after reconstitution into planar lipid bilayers. Molecular modelling was also used to tentatively explain experimental data. Since 30\% of the channel's mass are glycoconjugates, the effects of removing them were first investigated. Then, the effects of the neurotoxin Batrachotoxin and the anticonvulsant Lamotrigine were studied. Both drugs induced a significant increase in the channel's helical content and a molecular model shows that lamotrigine interacts with residues previously identified as forming the binding sites in the pore. Finally, the role of hydrophobic residues with long sidechains in the voltage sensors (S4s) was investigated. Recent research on related studies on VGSCs are discussed.},

abstract = {The origin of the action potential in the cochlea has been a long-standing puzzle. Because voltage-dependent Na+ (Nav) channels are essential for action potential generation, we investigated the detailed distribution of Nav1.6 and Nav1.2 in the cochlear ganglion, cochlear nerve, and organ of Corti, including the type I and type II ganglion cells. In most type I ganglion cells, Nav1.6 was present at the first nodes flanking the myelinated bipolar cell body and at subsequent nodes of Ranvier. In the other ganglion cells, including type II, Nav1.6 clustered in the initial segments of both of the axons that flank the unmyelinated bipolar ganglion cell bodies. In the organ of Corti, Nav1.6 was localized in the short segments of the afferent axons and their sensory endings beneath each inner hair cell. Surprisingly, the outer spiral fibers and their sensory endings were well labeled beneath the outer hair cells over their entire trajectory. In contrast, Nav1.2 in the organ of Corti was localized to the unmyelinated efferent axons and their endings on the inner and outer hair cells. We present a computational model illustrating the potential role of the Nav channel distribution described here. In the deaf mutant quivering mouse, the localization of Nav1.6 was disrupted in the sensory epithelium and ganglion. Together, these results suggest that distinct Nav channels generate and regenerate action potentials at multiple sites along the cochlear ganglion cells and nerve fibers, including the afferent endings, ganglionic initial segments, and nodes of Ranvier.},

abstract = {Voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, such as Kv1.2, are involved in the generation and propagation of action potentials. The Kv channel is a homotetramer, and each monomer is composed of a voltage-sensing domain (VSD) and a pore domain (PD). We analyzed the fluctuations of a model structure of Kv1.2 using elastic network models. The analysis suggested a network of coupled fluctuations of eight rigid structural units and seven hinges that may control the transition between the active and inactive states of the channel. For the most part, the network is composed of amino acids that are known to affect channel activity. The results suggested allosteric interactions and cooperativity between the subunits in the coupling between the motion of the VSD and the selectivity filter of the PD, in accordance with recent empirical data. There are no direct contacts between the VSDs of the four subunits, and the contacts between these and the PDs are loose, suggesting that the VSDs are capable of functioning independently. Indeed, they manifest many inherent fluctuations that are decoupled from the rest of the structure. In general, the analysis suggests that the two domains contribute to the channel function both individually and cooperatively.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to estimate the influence of force changes during relaxation from maximal voluntary contraction (MVC) of elbow flexors on electrical (EMG) and mechanical (MMG) activity of synergists and antagonists at different joint angles. Repeated studies were conducted on 22 young female students to estimate the EMG and MMG activity of the biceps brachii (BB), brachioradialis (BR), and triceps brachii (TB) muscles during relaxation from MVC at an optimal angle (the angle at which a subject achieved MVC=Lo), as well as at angles that were smaller (Ls=Lo-30 degrees ) and bigger (Ll=Lo+30 degrees ). Four testing sessions consisted of 2-s or 3-s MVC at each angle with simultaneous recording of EMG and MMG signals from BB, BR, and TB muscles. The EMG/MMG probes were used to record EMG and MMG signals. The results showed that the slow relaxation rate was related to a percentage decrease of the EMG amplitude (as measured by root mean square; EMG RMS) of the synergists, while the fast relaxation was related to the EMG RMS of the antagonist, independent of the joint angle. The MMG amplitude (MMG RMS) increased gradually during slow and fast relaxation (compared to the MMG RMS at MVC), indicating a bigger muscle oscillation during relaxation; the changes were related to the muscle tested and joint angle. It was found that, during the slow relaxation, the MMG RMS reflects the force amplitude changes in the BB muscle and the velocity of force changes in the BB and TB muscle (but not in the BR). During the fast relaxation, the MMG amplitude reflects a change in muscle force in the TB and BB muscles (but not in the BR), and the velocity of force changes in the synergists (not in the antagonist). The different contribution of the force and velocity of force changes during slow and fast relaxation to the MMG signal in the three muscle tested can be related to the different deactivation time of each muscle. In conclusion, the present results indicate that MMG recordings might be useful to measure the fast relaxation of individual muscle during voluntary contraction, but this needs be tested on isolated muscle.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to determine the effect of elbow joint position on electromyographic (EMG) and mechanomyographic (MMG) activities of agonist and antagonist muscles in young and old women. Surface EMG and MMG were recorded from the triceps and biceps brachii, and brachioradialis muscles during isometric elbow extensions in young and old women. The measurements were carried out at an optimal joint angle (A(o)), as well as at smaller (A(s) = A(o) - 30 degrees ) and larger (A(l) = A(o) + 30 degrees ) angles. The normalized to force EMG amplitude (RMS-EMG/F) was smaller in old women compared to young in all muscles. The RMS-EMG/F of the triceps brachii muscle was not affected by muscle length while that of the biceps brachii and brachioradialis muscles increased at shortest muscle length in both groups. The normalized to force MMG amplitude (RMS-MMG/F) was smaller in old than in young in the triceps brachii muscle only. There was an increase in RMS-MMG/F with triceps brachii and biceps brachii muscle shortening in both groups, and in the brachioradialis muscle -- in young only. Compared to young, older women exhibited a bigger force fluctuation during maximum voluntary contraction, but these did not contribute significantly to the RMS-MMG. Skinfold thickness accounted for the RMS-EMG/F and RMS-MMG/F differences seen between old and young women in the biceps brachii muscle only. It is concluded that, the EMG and MMG response to muscles length change in agonist and antagonist muscles is generally similar in old and young women but the optimal angle shifts toward a bigger value in older women.},

Each MU has parallel fibers uniformly scattered within a cylindrical volume of specified radius embedded in an anisotropic medium. Two action potentials, each modeled as a current tripole, are generated at the neuromuscular junction, propagate in opposite directions and extinguish at the fiber-tendon endings. The neuromuscular junctions and fiber-tendon endings are uniformly scattered within regions of specified width. Muscle fiber conduction velocity and average fiber length to the right and left of the center of the innervation zone are also specified. The signal produced by MU's with different geometries and conduction velocities are superimposed. Monopolar, single differential and double differential signals are computed from electrodes placed in equally spaced locations on the surface of the muscle and are displayed as functions of any of the model's parameters. Spectral and amplitude variables and conduction velocity are estimated from the surface signals and displayed as functions of any of the model's parameters. The influence of fiber-end effects, electrode misalignment, tissue anisotropy, MU's location and geometry are discussed. Part II of this paper will focus on the simulation and interpretation of experimental signals.},

abstract = {Experimental electromyogram (EMG) data from the human biceps brachii were simulated using the model described in [10] of this work. A multichannel linear electrode array, spanning the length of the biceps, was used to detect monopolar and bipolar signals, from which double differential signals were computed, during either voluntary or electrically elicited isometric contractions. For relatively low-level voluntary contractions (10\%-30\% of maximum force) individual firings of three to four-different motor units were identified and their waveforms were closely approximated by the model. Motor unit parameters such as depth, size, fiber orientation and length, location of innervation and tendonous zones, propagation velocity, and source width were estimated using the model. Two applications of the model are described. The first analyzes the effects of electrode rotation with respect to the muscle fiber direction and shows the possibility of conduction velocity (CV) over- and under-estimation. The second focuses on the myoelectric manifestations of fatigue during a sustained electrically elicited contraction and the interrelationship between muscle fiber CV, spectral and amplitude variables, and the length of the depolarization zone. It is concluded that a) surface EMG detection using an electrode array, when combined with a model of signal propagation, provides a useful method for understanding the physiological and anatomical determinants of EMG waveform characteristics and b) the model provides a way for the interpretation of fatigue plots.},

The right biceps brachii muscles of seven normal young adult subjects were tested. We observed that exponential functions could well represent the relationships between the normalized EMG root-mean-square (RMS) and the torque, the RMS and the muscle deformation SMG, and the RMS and the pennation angle SMG for the data of the contraction phase, with exponent coefficients of 0.0341 +/- 0.0148 (Mean SD), 0.0619 +/- 0.0273, and 0.0266 +/- 0.0076, respectively. In addition, the preliminary results also demonstrated linear relationships between the normalized torque and the muscle deformation as well as the pennation angle with the ratios of 9 .79 +/- 3.01 and 2.02 +/- 0.53, respectively. The overall mean R2 for the regressions was approximately 0.9 and the overall mean relative root mean square error (RRMSE) smaller than 15\%. The potential values of SMG together with EMG to provide a more comprehensive assessment for the muscle functions should be further investigated with more subjects and more muscle groups.},

abstract = {1. In this study we have recorded the activity of motor units of the important muscles acting across the elbow joint during combinations of voluntary isometric torques in flexion/extension direction and supination/pronation direction at different angles of the elbow joint. 2. Most muscles are not activated homogeneously; instead the population of motor units of muscles can be subdivided into several subpopulations. Inhomogeneous activation of the population of motor units in a muscle is a general finding and is not restricted to some multifunctional muscles. 3. Muscles can be activated even if their mechanical action does not contribute directly to the external torque. For example, m. triceps is activated during supination torques and thus compensates for the flexion component of the m. biceps. On the other hand, motor units in muscles are not necessarily activated if their mechanical action contributes to a prescribed torque. For example, there are motor units in the m. biceps that are activated during flexion torques, but not during supination torques. 4. The relative activation of the muscles depends on the elbow angle. Changing the elbow angle affects the mechanical advantage of different muscles differently. In general, muscles with the larger mechanical advantage receive the larger input. 5. We have calculated the relative contributions of some muscles to isometric torques. These contributions depend on the combination of the torques exerted. 6. Existing theoretical models on muscle coordination do not incorporate subpopulations of motor units and therefore need to be amended.},

abstract = {A model of the motor unit action potential was developed to investigate the amplitude and frequency spectrum contributions of motor units, located at various depths within muscle, to the surface detected electromyographic (EMG) signal. A dipole representation of the transmembrane current in a three-dimensional muscle volume was used to estimate detected individual muscle fiber action potentials. The effects of anisotropic muscle conductance, innervation zone location, propagation velocity, fiber length, electrode area, and electrode configuration were included in the fiber action potential model. A motor unit action potential was assumed to be the sum of the individual muscle fiber action potentials. A computational procedure, based on the notion of isopotential layers, was developed which substantially reduced the calculation time required to estimate motor unit action potentials. The simulations indicated that: 1) only those motor units with muscle fibers located within 10-12 mm of the electrodes would contribute significant signal energy to the surface EMG, 2) variation in surface area of electrodes has little effect on the detection depth of motor unit action potentials, 3) increased interelectrode spacing moderately increases detection depth, and 4) the frequency content of action potentials decreases steeply with increased electrode-motor unit territory distance.},

abstract = {The surface electromyogram (SEMG) is a complex, nonstationary signal. The spectrum of the SEMG is dependent on the force of contraction being generated and other factors like muscle fatigue and interelectrode distance (IED). The spectrum of the signal is time variant. This paper reports the experimental research conducted to study the influence of force of muscle contraction and IED on the SEMG signal using time-frequency (T-F) analysis. Two T-F techniques have been used: Wigner-Ville distribution (WVD) and Choi-Williams distribution (CWD). The experiment was conducted with the help of ten healthy volunteers (five males and five females) who performed isometric elbow flexions of the active right arm at 20\%, 50\%, and 80\% of their maximal voluntary contraction. The SEMG signal was recorded using surface electrodes placed at a distance of 18 and 36 mm over biceps brachii muscle. The results indicate that the two distributions were spread out across the frequency range at smaller IED. Further, regardless of the spacing, both distributions displayed increased spectral compression with time at higher contraction level.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of interelectrode distance (IED) on the absolute and normalized electromyographic (EMG) amplitude and mean power frequency (MPF) versus isokinetic and isometric torque relationships for the biceps brachii muscle. Ten adults [mean+/-SD age=22.0+/-3.4 years] performed submaximal to maximal, isokinetic and isometric muscle actions of the dominant forearm flexors. Following determination of isokinetic peak torque (PT) and the isometric maximum voluntary contraction (MVC), the subjects performed randomly ordered, submaximal step muscle actions in 10\% increments from 10\% to 90\% PT and MVC. Surface EMG signals were recorded simultaneously from bipolar electrode arrangements placed over the biceps brachii muscle with IEDs of 20, 40, and 60mm. Absolute and normalized EMG amplitude (muVrms and \%max) increased linearly with torque during the isokinetic and isometric muscle actions (r(2) range=0.988-0.998), but there were no significant changes for absolute or normalized EMG MPF (Hz or \%max) from 10\% to 100\% PT and MVC. In some cases, there were significant (p<0.05) differences among the three IED arrangements for absolute EMG amplitude and MPF values, but not for the normalized values. These findings suggested that for the biceps brachii muscle, IEDs between 20 and 60mm resulted in similar patterns for the EMG amplitude or MPF versus dynamic and isometric torque relationships. Furthermore, unlike the absolute EMG amplitude and MPF values, the normalized EMG data were not influenced by changes in IED between 20 and 60mm. Thus, normalized EMG data can be compared among previous studies that have utilized different IED arrangements.},

abstract = {To investigate the behavior of mechanomyogram (MMG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals in the time and frequency domains during sustained isometric contraction, MMG and surface EMG were obtained simultaneously from four muscles: upper trapezius (TP), anterior deltoid (DL), biceps brachii (BB), and brachioradialis (BR) of 10 healthy male subjects. Experimental conditions consisted of 27 combinations of 9 postures [3 shoulder angles (SA): 0 degree, 30 degrees, 60 degrees and 3 elbow angles (EA): 120 degrees, 90 degrees, 60 degrees] and 3 contraction levels: 20\%, 40\%, and 60\% of maximum voluntary contraction (MVC). Subjective evaluations of fatigue were also assessed using the Borg scale at intervals of 60, 30, and 10 sec at 20\%, 40\%, and 60\% MVC tests, respectively. The mean power frequency (MPF) and root mean square (RMS) of both signals were calculated. The current study found clear and significant relationships among physiological and psychological parameters on the one hand and SA and EA on the other. EA's effect on MVC was found to be significant. SA had a highly significant effect on both endurance time and Borg scale. In all experimental conditions, significant correlations were found between the changes in MPF and RMS of EMG in BB with SA and EA (or muscle length). In all four muscles, MMG frequency content was two or three times lower than EMG frequency content. During sustained isometric contraction, the EMG signal showed the well-known shift to lower frequencies (a continuous decrease from onset to completion of the contraction). In contrast, the MMG spectra did not show any shift, although its form changed (generally remaining about constant). Throughout the contraction, increased RMS of EMG was found for all tests, whereas in the MMG signal, a significant progressive increase in RMS was observed only at 20\% MVC in all four muscles. This supports the hypothesis that the RMS amplitude of the MMG signal produced during contraction is highly correlated with force production. Possible explanations for this behavioral difference between the MMG and EMG signals are discussed.},

abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine a course of force potentiation and/or inhibition during maximal voluntary eccentric action. Maximal voluntary force (MVC) of elbow flexion of ten healthy male volunteers was measured during isometric and isokinetic eccentric action starting from 80 degrees or 110 degrees and ending at 140 degrees elbow angle. Surface EMG was recorded from biceps brachii (BB) and brachioradialis (BR) muscles. Maximal voluntary eccentric force during the first 10 degrees of the movement was higher (P<0.001) than the maximal voluntary isometric preactivation force both in 80 degrees and in 110 degrees starting position at all three velocities (1, 2, and 4 rad s(-1)). The relative force potentiation was velocity dependent being smallest at the lowest stretching speed (P<0.01). Average EMG (aEMG) of BB and BR decreased as the joint angle increased both in eccentric and in isometric actions but the decrease in aEMG towards extension was somewhat higher in eccentric actions as compared to isometric. It was concluded that the force measured during the first 10 degrees of eccentric contraction always exceeded the maximal voluntary isometric preactivation force regardless of the joint angle or of the movement velocity. When maximal voluntary preactivation preceded the stretch, the relative force potentiation seemed to be greater at higher stretching velocities (velocity dependent) while at lower preactivation levels, the velocity dependence was not observed. Decreased muscle activation and lower maximal voluntary force towards the end of the movement suggested inhibition during maximal voluntary eccentric actions.},

abstract = {In this work the problem of rejection of motion artefacts from surface myoelectric signals, recorded during dynamic contractions, is studied. In fact, the extraction of frequency parameters and the detection of muscular activation patterns can be detrimentally affected by artefacts due to the movement of the surface electrodes, particularly stressed by the dynamic conditions of the exercise performed during measurement. In order to overcome this difficulty, four different filtering procedures have been tested and compared: a high-pass filtering procedure, a moving average procedure, a moving median procedure and a new adaptive wavelet based procedure, expressly designed for this work. Orthogonal Meyer wavelets are used with the aim of obtaining both a good reconstruction and a decomposition of the signal into non-overlapping bands. The four procedures have been tested with a set of different proofs utilising both synthetic and experimentally recorded myoelectric signals. The results show that the wavelet procedure performs better than the other methods both in information preservation and in time-detection. Moreover, the features of user-independence and adaptivity to the noise level suggest a wider range of applications of the proposed algorithm.},

abstract = {The surface electromyographic (sEMG) signal that originates in the muscle is inevitably contaminated by various noise signals or artifacts that originate at the skin-electrode interface, in the electronics that amplifies the signals, and in external sources. Modern technology is substantially immune to some of these noises, but not to the baseline noise and the movement artifact noise. These noise sources have frequency spectra that contaminate the low-frequency part of the sEMG frequency spectrum. There are many factors which must be taken into consideration when determining the appropriate filter specifications to remove these artifacts; they include the muscle tested and type of contraction, the sensor configuration, and specific noise source. The band-pass determination is always a compromise between (a) reducing noise and artifact contamination, and (b) preserving the desired information from the sEMG signal. This study was designed to investigate the effects of mechanical perturbations and noise that are typically encountered during sEMG recordings in clinical and related applications. The analysis established the relationship between the attenuation rates of the movement artifact and the sEMG signal as a function of the filter band pass. When this relationship is combined with other considerations related to the informational content of the signal, the signal distortion of filters, and the kinds of artifacts evaluated in this study, a Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz and a slope of 12 dB/oct is recommended for general use. The results of this study are relevant to biomechanical and clinical applications where the measurements of body dynamics and kinematics may include artifact sources.},

During contractions at 10 and 20\% of maximum force, conduction velocity and mean power frequency rose as the contraction progressed, whereas the conduction velocity and mean power frequency fell at 30 and 40\% of the maximum force. The mean EMG voltage rose during the contractions, with steeper increases for higher forces. It is argued that two principal factors influence the EMG during prolonged submaximal contractions: firstly, the fatigue of current active motor units, and, secondly, recruitment of fresh motor units. These factors act in opposition to muscle fiber conduction velocity. Recruitment gives an increase in average conduction velocity, whereas fatigue provokes a slowing in conduction velocity.},
